This is a first shot at porting the Hastie & Tibshirani mda package to
R --- and only for cool people with a brave heart :-)


All BRUTO stuff is missing because there are some unresolved symbols:
  R.binary: can't resolve symbol 'sgram_'
  R.binary: can't resolve symbol 'd_sign'
  R.binary: can't resolve symbol 'pack_'
  R.binary: can't resolve symbol 'unpack_'
  R.binary: can't resolve symbol 'sknotl_'
  R.binary: can't resolve symbol 'wmean_'
which I didn't have time to search/imitate/...

Mda and fda with MARS seem to work fine, though.

You'll need the e1071 and class packages from CRAN.

It also seems only to work with the new dataframe code that is
in the latest snapshot version (>= easter 1998).

Good luck,
