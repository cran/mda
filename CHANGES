Fortran stuff
-------------

convert ratfor sources to fortran

mspline.f:
change
	temp=dble(n-center) / cost - dfoff
to
	temp=dble(n-dble(center)) / cost - dfoff
because center is logical

remove unneeded symbols from *.f (warnings of f2c) 

convert *.f to C


In dumpdata.R:
--------------

remove checking if kmeans etc. are loaded (there is no find in R yet)

remove all bruto stuff (can't get compiled code working)

change all single to double
